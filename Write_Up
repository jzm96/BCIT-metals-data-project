This project compares investing in gold, silver, and platinum vs. the S&P 500 using daily data from 2017-2025. 
I joined precious metals prices, returns, and volatility stats with S&P 500 index data from FRED, getting about 2,500 matching days.

Includes the following graphs:

Correlation Heatmap
A color-coded heatmap shows how prices link up: gold to S&P 500 is dark red (0.91, strong tie), platinum light (0.48, weak). Easy to spot diversification winners.

Cumulative Returns Plot
Line graph tracks growth over time: silver line climbs highest (498% total), S&P steady, gold smooth. Metals beat stocks in crashes.

Price Trends
Subplots compare daily prices: S&P spikes with markets, gold stable. Great for Power BI dashboards to demo risk vs. reward.

Built in Python/Jupyter with simple merges and stats. Great for Power BI visuals or finance portfolios—code is clean and easy to extend.
The project used simple graphs in Jupyter and Power BI to show key insights from the merged data.

Key results: Gold tracks stocks closely (corr. 0.91), silver medium (0.78), platinum less (0.48) for diversification. 
Silver had top returns (498%), gold best risk-adjusted gains (Sharpe 0.99 vs. S&P's 0.82).

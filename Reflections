Are you proud of your project?  Why or why not?
  No I am not, I don't feel very fluent in using github/terminal. I will look into taking a online course over the summer.

What did you learn about the topic you chose?
  I learned that gold and silver, moreso gold would have been an excellent invest, especially in times of heavy inflation.

What did you learn about working with data in git?
  I learned how to create clear graphs that are easy to understand and help with insight.

Did you choose to include your work in Assignment 3?  Why or why not?
  No I did not because I am unable to push it through terminal to update the actual work on github website. I have used AI for clear step instructions but each time I do what it says it says repo not found,
  I am clearly on the current branch and copy and pasted the URL of the repo but after the push it says fatal error, repo not found.

Did you use AI as part of the process?  How did that go?
  Yes definetly helped with the project. I like to use it because I ask for a detailed step by step instructions on what I need to do. That way I can learn and understand what i'm doing, while also
  getting what I need done.

What were your main challenges?
  The first few weeks were fine and I could understand, near the end with the branching and working on seperate branch on terminal i'm not sure the what went wrong and AI could not give me a fix. 
  Thus I was unable to update my github page and move around my files.
